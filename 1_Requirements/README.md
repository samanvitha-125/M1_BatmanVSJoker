* The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of four cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
* An opponent can prevent a win by blocking the completion of the opponent's line.

## SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY :

### TIME COMPLEXITY :
* O(1) time complexity that requires O(n) space complexity. it is simpler to write, and debug and more importantly, there are no loops!

### SPACE COMPLEXITY :
* Combinatorial game theory has several ways of measuring game complexity.
* The state-space complexity of a game is the number of legal game positions reachable from the initial position of the game.
* The game tree size is the total number of possible games that can be played: the number of leaf nodes in the game tree rooted at the game's initial position.
* Decision complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.
* The game-tree complexity of a game is the number of leaf nodes in the smallest full-width decision tree that establishes the value of the initial position.
* O(n) in space complexity.

## WHERE :

* This game can be played on a book or a paper or on the computer/system.

## HOW :

* They can install the game on the mobile or laptop.

## Best Methods To Be Followed

* Used functions to decrease dependency on main function
* Used structures and arrays to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of Employee management system.
* Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions
* Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty
* Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.
